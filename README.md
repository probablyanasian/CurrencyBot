Commands:

    Out of debug mode:
    ```
    cur [none]/[id]/[username]/[username#discrim]: 0-1 parameter; Gets the current amount of money someone owns <Default: self>

    .getprefix: no parameters, works without the prefix as a static command <Default returns: '.'>
    ```

    Owner only:
    ```
    flushdb: no parameters; Clears the currently used RedisDB
    ```

    In debug mode:
